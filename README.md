# Yet Another Angular Boiler Plate


## Configure
  + tasks/config.json


## DIY Tasks
  + All tasks can be taken out and removed from the `/tasks/`.  They are auto loaded
  + New tasks should extend `tasks/config.js` in order to get configure paths


## Install
  + npm install
  + bower install
  + gulp \[--prod\] \[watch\]


## Modes
  + gulp *This ends up being development, it will start a watch*
  + gulp --prod *Production quality everything is minified and no extra sources are created*
  + gulp watch *Runs your tests, livereload, and quality checks*


## Coming Soon
  + Font Awesome
  + imagemin


## SASS
  + Anything inside of the: `src/scss/application.scss` will be called by default
  + The Watch file by default adds a few more nested searchs since you are expected to put all of your styles in their own directory

  + Provided below are some references to angular and javascript
